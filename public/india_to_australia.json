Declare fair market value for free items—non-compliance delays clearance.\nGifts & Samples\nGifts from India face duties (per India’s 2019 rule)—samples need material details or face quarantine.\nClearance Comments\nAustralian Customs randomly inspects 5% of shipments, delaying them 24-72 hours.\nImport Charges\nUnder AUD 1,000 (FOB): no charges (except alcohol/tobacco). Over AUD 1,000: 10% GST, possible 5% duty, plus AUD 88 fee (or AUD 190 if over AUD 10,000).",
