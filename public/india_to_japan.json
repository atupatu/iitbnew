        "Content": "CITES Certificate\nWhen shipping goods from India to Japan that include endangered species products (e.g., HS 4301 for shawls made from Shahtoosh wool), a CITES Certificate is mandatory under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Issued by India’s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, it must detail the species (e.g., Capra falconeri), source (e.g., legally harvested), and quantity. To avoid delays at Japanese ports like Narita (NRT), send the original certificate via express service (e.g., UPS Worldwide Express) ahead of the shipment. Japan Customs Service enforces strict checks, and missing documentation leads to seizure or return at the shipper’s expense—e.g., a €200-300 cost for a returned silk scarf batch. Clearance typically adds 2-4 days with proper paperwork.\n\nCustoms Clearance Process\nCustoms Procedure Agent\nFor Indian exporters without a Japan-based importer, Japan Customs Law requires appointing a Customs Procedure Agent (CPA)—a licensed Japanese entity (e.g., a Tokyo-based logistics firm) to handle import declarations. Under Article 2 of the Customs Law, an ‘importer’ must have rights to the cargo at declaration time (e.g., ownership or lease). If no importer exists, the Indian exporter must notify Japan Customs of the CPA via the NACCS (Nippon Automated Cargo and Port Consolidated System) at least 24 hours before arrival. Examples include: a lessee under a machinery lease (e.g., HS 8479), a consignee for sales (e.g., HS 6204 textiles), or a processor for repairs (e.g., HS 8517 electronics). Contact the Japan Customs office (https://www.customs.go.jp/) for CPA lists—failure to appoint delays clearance by 3-5 days.\n\nPacking List\nA packing list isn’t mandatory for Indian shipments to Japan but is recommended for complex consignments (e.g., mixed electronics with HS 8471 and HS 8525). It should detail item descriptions (e.g., ‘LED monitors, 10 units’), quantities, and weights—e.g., ‘50 kg total, 5 kg/unit’. Including it with the invoice speeds clearance at Osaka by 1-2 days, avoiding customs queries.\n\nCertificate of Origin\nImports of silk or silk-related products from India (e.g., HS 5007 for silk sarees or HS 6304 for silk linens) require a Certificate of Origin (COO) to verify Indian origin, especially under the India-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA). Issued by the Indian Chamber of Commerce or Export Promotion Council for Textiles, it must be original, signed in ink, and include a detailed description (e.g., ‘handwoven silk sarees, 20 pcs, made in Varanasi’). Japan Customs may request this for duty reductions (e.g., 2.5% instead of 5% on HS 5007)—without it, full duties apply, adding ¥10,000-¥20,000 to a ¥500,000 shipment.\n\nMSDS-NON DG\nGoods under IATA Special Provisions A67 (e.g., HS 3402 for non-hazardous cleaning agents) from India to Japan require a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) or Non-Dangerous Goods (NON DG) declaration. While not mandatory for all shipments, UAE authorities—often a transit hub for India-Japan routes—may hold shipments lacking these at Dubai (DXB), causing 2-4 day delays. For a shipment of Indian herbal soaps, include an MSDS stating ‘non-hazardous, no flammable components’ and upload copies to UPS’s IDIS system. This ensures smooth transit and delivery to Tokyo, avoiding ¥5,000-¥10,000 in penalty fees.",

For samples (e.g., HS 3304 for cosmetic testers), Japan allows small quantities (e.g., 10 perfume vials) without formal clearance if marked ‘Samples—No Commercial Value’ on the invoice.
