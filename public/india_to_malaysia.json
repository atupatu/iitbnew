        "Content": "CITES Certificate\nFor Indian shipments to Malaysia containing endangered species products (e.g., HS 4103 for turtle leather bags), a CITES Certificate is required under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Issued by India’s Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, it must detail the species (e.g., Chelonia mydas), legal sourcing, and quantity (e.g., ‘5 bags’). Send the original via express service (e.g., UPS Worldwide Express) ahead of arrival at Kuala Lumpur (KUL) to avoid seizure or return—e.g., a MYR 1,000 cost for a 5 kg shipment. Clearance delays 2-4 days without it, per Malaysia’s Department of Wildlife and National Parks (PERHILITAN).\n\nPacking List\nAll non-document shipments from India to Malaysia (e.g., HS 6204 kurtas) require a packing list alongside the commercial invoice. It should list items (e.g., ‘cotton shirts, 20 pcs’), quantities, weights (e.g., ‘10 kg total, 0.5 kg each’), and package count—e.g., ‘2 boxes’. Submit it in English to Royal Malaysian Customs Service (RMCS) via UPS—missing lists delay clearance at Johor Bahru by 1-3 days, risking MYR 200-500 fines.\n\nStandards and Industrial Institute of Malaysia (SIRIM)\nSIRIM, established in 1996, oversees quality standards for Malaysian imports. Indian goods like communication devices (e.g., HS 8517 for Wi-Fi routers), telecom equipment (e.g., HS 8518 for headsets), computers (e.g., HS 8471 for laptops), tablets (e.g., HS 8471 for iPads), or items with communication modules (e.g., HS 9503 for smart toys) need SIRIM certification. The Malaysian importer must apply for an import permit pre-arrival via SIRIM’s portal (https://www.sirim.my/), providing product specs and test reports—e.g., a Delhi exporter’s router needs SIRIM approval before shipping. UPS Malaysia Brokerage offers SIRIM contact info but doesn’t process permits—delays of 3-7 days apply without it.\n\nMSDS-NON DG\nIndian goods under IATA Special Provisions A67 (e.g., HS 3401 for non-hazardous soaps) require a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) or Non-Dangerous Goods (NON DG) declaration. Though not mandatory for all shipments, UAE authorities—often a transit point from India to Malaysia—may hold shipments at Dubai (DXB) without these, causing 2-4 day delays. For a 10 kg soap shipment, include an MSDS stating ‘non-flammable, safe for air transport’ and upload copies to UPS’s IDIS system—avoids MYR 300-600 in penalties and ensures delivery to Penang.",

        "Content": "Clearance Comments\nFor Indian dutiable shipments to Malaysia with FOB value over MYR 10,000 (e.g., MYR 15,000 for HS 7113 jewelry), the consignee must submit a Supplementary Customs Form No. 1A via EDI to RMCS, detailing valuation—e.g., ‘gold necklaces, 5 pcs, MYR 3,000 each’. Duties (e.g., 10% = MYR 1,500) and sales tax (6% = MYR 990) apply, payable at clearance in Port Klang. Non-dutiable shipments up to MYR 2,000 (e.g., MYR 1,800 spices) clear instantly unless restricted—e.g., no Form 1A for HS 0904 turmeric—saving 1-2 days.\n\nPayment by Credit Card\nMalaysia accepts credit card payments for freight and import charges upon delivery—e.g., MYR 2,000 for a Mumbai-to-KL shipment. Contact UPS Malaysia (1-800-88-787) for accepted cards (e.g., Visa, Mastercard). Freight collect from India may face restrictions—confirm with UPS India (1-800-102-7171) pre-shipment to avoid MYR 100-200 surcharges.\n\nGifts & Samples\nSince December 12, 2019, gifts imported into India attract duties, but for India-to-Malaysia, see ‘Gift Exemptions’. Samples (e.g., HS 3304 perfume testers) under MYR 500 clear duty-free if marked ‘Samples—No Commercial Value’—e.g., 10 vials avoid MYR 50 duty—otherwise, 1-2 day delays apply.\n\nPost Office Boxes\nUPS doesn’t deliver Indian shipments to P.O. Boxes in Malaysia—e.g., no ‘P.O. Box 456, KL’. Use a full address (e.g., ‘12 Jalan Ampang, 50450 Kuala Lumpur’), consignee name (e.g., ‘Ahmad Bin Ismail’), and phone (e.g., ‘+60 3-1234-5678’)—missing info risks MYR 200-300 return fees or 2-3 day delays.",
